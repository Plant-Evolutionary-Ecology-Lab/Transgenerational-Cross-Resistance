# Transgenerational-Cross-Resistance
Repository of the transgerational cross resistance project showing that non-genetic traits are transgnerationally retained or primed even after five clonal generations without stress, affecting fitness of the gian duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) and its aphid herbivore (Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae).
