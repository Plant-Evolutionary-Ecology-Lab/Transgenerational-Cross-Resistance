# Abstract
Transgenerational plasticity in plants is an increasingly recognized phenomenon, yet it is mostly unclear whether transgenerational plasticity is relevant for plant and herbivore fitness, particularly outdoors. Using monoclonal strains of the giant duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza, we assessed whether pre-treating plants with copper excess indoors and outdoors alters plant phenotypes and fitness under different recurring stresses when the initial and final stresses are separated by five asexual generations. Subsequently, we manipulated transgenerationally plastic phenotypes to assess their effect on the fitness of the plants and its major native herbivore, the waterlily aphid (Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae). Outdoors, copper pre-treatment tended to increase plant growth rates exclusively under recurring copper excess. Indoors, copper pre-treatment altered plant growth rates in a genotype- and environment-dependent manner, with particularly strong effects under recurring copper excess and aphid herbivory. Copper excess induced defensive anthocyanins, and these elevated levels were transgenerationally retained. Copper pre-treatment also primed the accumulation of jasmonates by 50-100% under recurring copper excess and aphid herbivory and increased aphid growth rates by up to 50%. Accordingly, the externally applied jasmonate benefitted aphid fitness. Taken together, this study shows that transgenerational plasticity is relevant for both plant and herbivore fitness, which highlights its role in species interactions and ecosystem functioning.
